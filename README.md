#A survey of the microcosme. Or the anatomie of the bodies of man and woman wherein the skin, veins, nerves, muscles, bones, sinews and ligaments thereof are accurately delineated, and so disposed by pasting, as that each part of the said bodies both inward and outward are exactly represented. Useful for all doctors, chyryrgeons, statuaries, painters, &c. By Michael Spaher of Tyrol, and Remilinus. Englished by John Ireton Chyrurgeon.#
